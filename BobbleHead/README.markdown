Bobble Head
===========

This program is unbelievable.  Literally, you will run the program and then not believe what is happening.  
You will then proceed to call [Myth Busters] (http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/mythbusters) and even *they* will
find this program incredible.  

Features
--------

This program includes:
	* My head bobbling.
	* Music (albeit just two versions of the same song).
	* The warm fuzzy feeling that it is *not* written in VB6.
	
	
Acknowledgments
---------------

I would like to thank my father for carefully editing everything except my face out for the bobbling picture.  
Also for downloading the included music (although most likely illegally).
